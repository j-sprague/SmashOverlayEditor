# SmashOverlayEditor

Java program that allows you to easily edit a stream overlay for a Smash Ultimate tournament. The program itself edits image+text files that the OBS or other broadcasting software reads and allows the edits to be done in a very easy to read interface.

This project has not been worked on since late 2021, more documentation may be added later on.
